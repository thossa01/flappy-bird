With this project I:
•	Created a fun, interactive FLAPPY BIRD game in Java, featuring real-time score tracking and an engaging gameplay experience.
•	Implemented a game reset feature, allowing users to restart and challenge themselves for higher scores once the game is over, enhancing replayability and user engagement.
